FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Blacksburg Labs Launches Verity AI: The Future of Fake News Detection is Here
Blacksburg, VA – April 11, 2025
Today, Blacksburg Labs is proud to announce the official release of Verity AI, a cutting-edge fake news detection tool designed to aid users in the fight against misinformation. Leveraging neural network technology and a comprehensive Kaggle dataset, Verity AI classifies news articles as credible or fraudulent.
Verity AI’s state-of-the-art system processes user input in two ways. Users can either paste text directly into the web interface or simply provide a URL. In the URL case, Verity AI employs Beautiful Soup to automatically scrape and extract the full text from the website before analyzing it. The final result provides users with a clear, reliable credibility score.
Built as a full-stack web application, Verity AI features a React.js frontend for a seamless user experience and a Python/Flask backend that handles data preprocessing, model predictions, and real-time JSON responses. This architecture allows it to be accessible on any device. 
“Our mission is to help people separate fact from fiction in an era overwhelmed by misinformation,” said Afeef Ali, Engineer at Blacksburg Labs. “We’re proud to offer a tool that’s both powerful and easy to use.”
Developed with agile methodologies and managed via GitLab for efficient version control, Verity AI is the product of a collaborative effort that emphasizes continuous improvement. Unlike other fake news detection tools, Verity AI is a free tool that stands out through its high accuracy, ease of use, and real-time analysis. By integrating user feedback and continuous updates, it remains at the forefront of technological innovation and practical usability.
